# FAQ

* Why ?

Because I can.

* Why mongodb ?

I'm lazy and I wanted to store the whole data returned by the Mastodon API "just in case". Mongo is nice for this.

* Why Python 3.6 only ?

Because I wanted to play with mypy and I prefer type annotations to `# type:` comments

* What's next ?

Nothing. I just wanted a searchable backup of my toots from the command line, so I don't think any new feature needs to be added.

I could spend more time on the conversion from html to text maybe, but apart from that I consider this project done.
